        <p>The FLL competition is an international robotics contest for elementary and middle school students. Each year the FLL introduces a scientific or real-world challenge that each team from around the world need to research on and build their robots in a way that will overcome the challenge and complete all the obstacles. This year’s theme/challenge is called “Hydro Dynamics”, each team will have build robots that will solve missions that have to do with water, the missions are given in advance so that the teams will know how to program their robots.</p>
